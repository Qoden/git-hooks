# git-hooks

Standard githooks to be used in projects by all developers in Qoden

Should be placed into .git/hooks subfolder of your codebase.

Those githooks add a prefix to each commit message containing the current branch name in angle brackets. 

It is very useful when reviewing history of gitflow-styled repository with lots of merged branches.
